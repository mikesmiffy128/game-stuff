I'm basically just publishing this because someone wanted my L4D2 crosshair,
and I figured I might as well just dump all this stuff somewhere just in case it
was useful to anyone.

For licence info, look for either LICENCE files (which apply to the directory
they're in) or notes at the top of individual files. Most of it's either
permissive or fully public domain, depending on how much I care about the
specific thing. :^)
