xhair: a trivial crosshair replacement for DirectX games with bad/no built in
crosshairs. I threw it together for use with L4D2 and also occasionally use it
for Killing Floor. Apparently a lot of L4D2 players do some dumb thing with
Mumble's overlay; that seems awfully complicated when you can just use a
standalone program, hence this standalone program.

Note: this works with any fullscreen DirectX game but probably does not work
with OpenGL games because they take a short-circuit path through Windows'
compositor which prevents anything from drawing on top.

Customisation: the config.cs file can be edited to tweak the appearance of the
thing, similar to a Suckless config.h. Of course it's not fully in the spirit of
Suckless since it's written in C# and runs on Windows - I just didn't feel like
implementing a config parser.

Compiling: you need the SDK for .NET 4.6.1, then just run build.bat. If that
doesn't work, don't ask me, I dunno.
